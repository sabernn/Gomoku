# Homework 2

Your task in this homework is to implement the Monte Carlo Tree Search used in AlphaZero for the board game Gomoku (five in a line). Your code must be a subclass of the class MCTSBase. The MCTSBase class already implemented the overall search process. You need to fill in the missing components by implementing the abstract methods in the MCTSBase class as well as the ones in the TreeNode class.
